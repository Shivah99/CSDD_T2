## Go Programming and GitHub Collaboration ##
### Objective: ###
The goal of this assignment is for each student to create a simple Go application that prints a personalized greeting. Each student will host their project on GitHub, showcasing their ability to use version control and repository management. The team lead will compile and submit a document with the project links of all team members.

### Requirements: ###
#### Tools Needed: #### 
Go programming language, Git, and a GitHub account.
### Number of Members Per Team: ###
4-5 students (including a team lead).
### Assignment Tasks:
### Project Setup: 

Each team member must Install Go on their local machine.
Set up a new GitHub repository for their Go project.
Ensure the repository is public to allow grading and collaboration.
### Go Application Development: Each team member is required to:

Create a single Go file in their repository (main.go).
Write a Go program in main.go that prints a greeting in the format: Hello from [Student Name] [Student ID]. For example, a student named Maziar with student ID 500112233 would have their program print: Hello from Maziar 500112233.
Commit and push the main.go file to their GitHub repository.

### Documentation:

Each student must include a README.md file in their repository that explains the purpose of the program and includes instructions on how to run it.
Collaboration Proof:

Encourage students to star and fork each other's repositories to promote interaction and feedback.

### Final Submission by Team Lead:

The team lead is responsible for compiling a PDF document that includes:
A brief description of the assignment.
The list of team members with their respective roles.
Links to the GitHub repositories of each team member.
Submit the PDF document to the designated submission platform or email it to the instructor by the due date.

### Assessment Criteria:
Correctness of the Go program (prints the required greeting).
Proper use of Git (commits with meaningful messages, correct file pushing).
The quality and clarity of the README.md file.
Timeliness of the submission.
Completeness of the final PDF document submitted by the team lead.

### Due Date:
The entire assignment is due one week from today.
